**Chicago Crime Analyzer**
**Project Overview**
The Chicago Crime Analyzer is a data-driven project aimed at analyzing crime patterns in Chicago to assist law enforcement, policymakers, and communities in crime prevention and resource allocation. By leveraging data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualizations, geographic mapping, and trend analysis, the project provides actionable insights into crime trends, hotspots, and law enforcement effectiveness.

**Key Features**
**Crime Hotspot Identification** – Detect high-crime areas to optimize law enforcement resource allocation.
**Trend & Seasonality Analysis** – Identify patterns based on time (hour, day, month, year) to anticipate crime surges.
**Arrest Efficiency Analysis** – Evaluate arrest rates for different crime types and locations.
**Neighborhood Safety Assessment** – Rank communities based on crime rates for public awareness and urban planning.
**Crime Prediction & Prevention** – Use historical data to predict future crime trends.
**Impact Analysis of Law Enforcement** – Measure how arrests impact crime reduction.
**Public Awareness & Policy Development** – Inform crime prevention initiatives and urban infrastructure improvements.
